# Micaella-Horiseon-Refactor

## Description
The Horiseon webpage originally had a nice display but had a non-working navigation link and fully non-semantic elements in its HTML code which was requiring extra lines of code that could be avoided. To combat this, I added an id to the nav list item that was missing the navigation link and I changed the div tags to semantic elements and tags. This allowed me to change a few class rules to element rules in CSS. I consolidated some class rules that all had the same code. I also ensured that the heading tags (h1--> h4) are in numerical order. To make the webpage more accessible, I added alt text to each of the images in the HTML. Ultimately, the webpage should now have easily readable code that can be built upon for further interactivity.
